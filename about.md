Centrarium is a custom theme for Jekyll, made by [Ben Centra][bencentra] for his own blog. He'd be humbled if you liked it enough to use it as well! Installation and configuration instructions can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bencentra/centrarium).

I am Ares Ceng.This is my first time to learn markdown language and use it the build up a website. I felt really really really excited!

Bertrand de Beauvoir had said that weman was not born to be weman but shaped to be. I believe the power of writing. It converts into a recoder and have a shaper sense to ordinary life. Make the boring life more beautiful.
